## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how quite flexible it is designing the mobile view first.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue to work with Flexbox as I feel I'm not too comfortable with it just yet. I would also start creating the mobile design first before designing for wider screens.
